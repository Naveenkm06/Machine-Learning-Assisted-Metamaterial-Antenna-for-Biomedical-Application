## Background
With advancements in biomedical technology, there is a pressing need for non-invasive and efficient diagnostic methods. Metamaterials, which have unique electromagnetic properties, show promise for such applications. The Double Split Ring Resonator (DSRR) antenna used here operates within the THz range and allows for enhanced detection sensitivity due to its capability to respond uniquely to different skin tissues.
## Objectives
*Design a DSRR-based metamaterial antenna.

*Simulate the antenna response for normal and cancerous skin models.

*Extract electromagnetic response data for both tissue types.

*Train a machine learning model to classify tissue types based on reflection coefficients.

*Validate the system's accuracy and reliability for biomedical diagnostics.
## Methodology
Frequency Calculation: Calculated the optimal operating frequency range (0.1â€“10 THz).

Simulation: Conducted simulations in ANSYS HFSS to design the antenna and model the skin layers.

Data Extraction: Collected reflection coefficients from the simulated models.

Machine Learning: Applied a Random Forest Classifier to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues using extracted data.
## Design and Simulation
Metamaterial Antenna Design: Created using a DSRR structure optimized for THz frequencies.

Normal vs. Cancerous Skin Models: Dielectric properties and thicknesses were adjusted for realistic modeling.

Data Collection: Reflection coefficients at various frequencies were recorded to form the dataset for classification.
## Machine Learning Analysis
A Random Forest Classifier was implemented to classify skin tissue based on the reflection data


Data Preprocessing: Normalized data and handled missing values.

Model Training: Trained and tested on 80/20 split data.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluated model accuracy, MSE, MAE, precision, recall, and F1 score.
## Results
Antenna Performance: The antenna achieved optimized performance in the terahertz range, with clear differentiation in reflection coefficients between normal and cancerous tissues.

Random Forest Model: Achieved 93% accuracy, demonstrating effective classification of skin tissues based on THz response.
## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates a method for non-invasive skin cancer detection using metamaterial antenna technology combined with machine learning. The results showcase potential applications in biomedical diagnostics, particularly for identifying cancerous tissue without the need for invasive procedures.
